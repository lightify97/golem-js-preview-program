# Task #5 - Running tasks in parallel

## Why

The Golem Task model is particularly useful if you can split the job into chunks that can be run in parallel. 

In this challenge, you will learn how to run tasks in parallel.

## Task description

Create an app that will take a folder name as input and will upscale all `jpg` images from that folder on remote nodes. You can use the `realesr` tool in the provided image. 

For this task create a set of 5 low-resolution anime images as input data. Your script should execute the tasks in parallel. Results should be stored in the same folder under `upscaled_<originalName>.jpg` name.

### Steps

Please observe how long it takes to complete the technical part of the tasks. We will ask you for such information in the feedback form.

0. Prepare test data.

2. Create a requestor script that will run the image conversion.

3. Add changes in the `run-tasks-in-parallel` directory.

4. [Fill out the feedback form](./FEEDBACK.md) and publish changes in your repository fork.
