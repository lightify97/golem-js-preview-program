### Feedback

#### JS SDK Docs

Could you find the necessary information? If not what topics were difficult to find?

> The docs are very well written and easy to follow. I did not have any issues finding the information I needed. However I'd suggest adding a `Use Cases` section that specifies how and what type of applications can be built on the Golem network. I think this would be very useful for developers to get a better understanding of the capabilities of the network.

---

How would you change the structure/navigation of the docs? Recommend changes.

> Docs are structured very nicely (a big improvement from the last time versin of the docs). I think the structure is very intuitive and easy to follow.

---

Are examples and tutorials useful? What was missing, and what was too detailed or unnecessary?

> Yes the examples and tutorials are very helpful.

---

Have you noticed any errors? Please describe them or provide links to issues if you have already reported them.

> I have not noticed any errors.

#### JS golem-js

Is JS SDK API intuitive and helps solve the tasks? If not, what would you change?

> Yes the API is very intuitive and easy to use. I did not have any issues using the API. However the true test would be in more complex scenarios and use cases.

---

Have you encountered any errors in the golem-js lib? Provide the link(s) to the issue(s) in `golem-js` [repository](https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-js/issues) which you had reported.

> No I have not encountered any errors.

---

What additional features would you add?

> That would unfold as I use the API in more complex scenarios. For now I think the API is very well designed and easy to use.

#### General feedback

What was your general experience with Golem Network? What was difficult/frustrating?
What was a nice surprise?

> Eveything was very smooth and easy to follow. I did not have any issues. I think the Golem Network is a very promising project and I'm very excited to see how it evolves.

In what projects could you utilize Golem Network?

> Golem network can be utilized in a wide range of projects. I think it would be very useful for computationally intensive tasks such as machine learning, data analysis, etc. Personally, I'm very interested in exploring the possibilities of using Golem Network for web applications like I do on a cloud provider.

#### Preview Program

Were the tasks and instructions adequate and clear?

> Yes the tasks and instructions were very clear and easy to follow.

Is there anything you would improve about the JS Preview program?

> The common feedback elements about preview program and general feedback are repeated in every task. There should be a single feedback file for repeating and general elements. The feedback files for each task should only contain feedback specific to that task.
