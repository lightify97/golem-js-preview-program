# Golem JS Preview Program Feedback Form

## Introduction

Thank you for taking the time to complete this Golem JS Preview Program task!

We appreciate your valuable feedback and suggestions on how to improve the Golem Network.
Please fill out the form below:

## Task: #1 - Run a task in the Golem Network

### Estimated completion time:

| Task Step                  | Completion Time (in minutes) |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Modify a `main.mjs` script | 30                           |

List any additional steps that were necessary to resolve the task (other than the steps in the README.md):

-   To get familiar with yagna, I had to get help from the yagna CLI and dable with different commands to get myself comfortable with different commands.
-   I had to look up the documentation to get an overview of how to run tasks on the providers. The instructions in the documentation are clearly and consicely explained. I was able to find the relevant information in a single place and nicely organized.

### Feedback:

#### JS SDK Docs

---

Could you find the necessary information? If not what topics were difficult to find?

**_Yes, the necessary information is easily accessible. Moreover finding / searching specific terms or keywords was very smooth with the search functionality._**

---

How would you change the structure/navigation of the docs? Recommend changes.

**_Writing good documentation is hard. But organizing and structuring it is an even harder task. Nevertheless the golem documentation is very well written. But I'd like to point out a few things._**

(a) _Documentation should be structured as a book with a defined order i.e. starting from very basics to advanced topics. This makes it easier for every type of user get a complete understanding of the system._

(b) _The documentation should be written in a way that it is easy to understand for a beginner as well as an advanced user._

(c) _There should be extensive back and forth linking between different sections of the documentation. This helps the reader to get a better understanding of the topic._

(d) _One particular thing that I liked about the golem documentation is that it is very well organized. The documentation is divided into different sections and each section is further divided into subsections. This makes it very easy to navigate through the documentation. But finding which page I'm currently on is a bit difficult. I'd suggest adding a breadcrumb navigation to the documentation. This will help the reader to know which page he/she is currently on and also help to navigate back to the previous page._

---

Are examples and tutorials useful? What was missing, and what was too detailed or unnecessary?

**_Yes, the examples and tutorials are very useful. They are very well written and easy to understand. The examples are very detailed and cover all the necessary information. I didn't find anything missing from the examples._**

---

Have you noticed any errors? Please describe them or provide links to issues if you have already reported them.

**_No, I didn't find any errors in the documentation._**

#### JS golem-js

Is JS SDK API intuitive and helps solve the tasks? If not, what would you change?

Yes, the JS SDK API is very intuitive and easy to use. However, I'd like to point out about the API reference. The API reference is low level details but here in golem's case it's very very verbose to the point of confusion. Here's an example page from API docs. ![Page 1 Golem API ref](https://i.imgur.com/F3mQ92e.png)
![Page 2 Golem API ref](https://i.imgur.com/LLyjmp9.png)

In contrast see the API reference of [Google Maps SDK](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/street-view-service) ![web3.js API ref](https://i.imgur.com/uqMBFnX.png)

Description is grossly missing from the golem API reference. I'd suggest adding a description to each function and also add a description to each parameter. This will help the user to get a better understanding of the function and its parameters.

---

Have you encountered any errors in the golem-js lib? Provide the link(s) to the issue(s) in `golem-js` [repository](https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-js/issues) which you had reported.

**_No, I haven't encountered any errors in the golem-js lib so far._**

---

What additional features would you add?

#### General feedback:

What was your general experience with Golem Network? What was difficult/frustrating?
What was a nice surprise?

**_My general experience with Golem Network was very good. I was able to get started very quickly. I was surprised with the how simple and sophisticated Yagna is_**.

In what projects could you utilize Golem Network?

_Recently I have been working on a peer-to-peer ride sharing system. I'm starting to think of some use cases where I can utilize Golem Network. I'll update this section once I have a clear idea._

#### Preview Program

Were the tasks and instructions adequate and clear?

**_Yes, the tasks and instructions were very clear and easy to follow. However some of the questions asked here are not justifiable for the first task. I'd suggest asking these questions after the user has completed a few tasks._**

---

Is there anything you would improve about the JS Preview program?

_I'd suggest adding a few more tasks to the preview program. This will help the user to get a better understanding of the system._
