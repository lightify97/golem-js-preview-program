# Task #2 - Download results 

## Why

Golem users can download self-generated files on the provider node back to their computer.

In this exercise, you will learn how to run a script that produces a file and how to download that file to your node.

## Task description

Create a script that will accept the user-provided text as input and convert it to `.mp3` on the Golem Network, download the output, and save it on your disk. For this task, you can use the Golem-provided image containing both `ffmpeg` and `speak`. The image's `hash` is `0e24cd9c3c019143fba94debce69f37353d0157ac4329050870e9ae8`.

### Steps

Please observe how long it takes to complete the technical part of the tasks. We will ask you for such information in the feedback form.

1. Modify the `main.mjs` script to execute the text-2-speech conversion commands.

2. Run the script and verify the output.

3. Add changes in the `text-2-speech` directory.

4. [Fill out the feedback form](./FEEDBACK.md) and publish changes in your repository fork.
