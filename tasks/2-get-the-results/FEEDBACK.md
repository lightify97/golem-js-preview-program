### Feedback

#### JS SDK Docs

Could you find the necessary information? If not what topics were difficult to find?

> Yes the necceasry information for the task was readily available in the docs. I did not have any issues finding the information I needed.

---

How would you change the structure/navigation of the docs? Recommend changes.

> For this task I found the documentation's structure very nice. Since I only had to visit one page, I'm pretty satisfied with how the docs are structured.  
> Are examples and tutorials useful? What was missing, and what was too detailed or unnecessary?
> Yes these are very useful with right amount of detail. I haven't found anything unnecessary or missing.

---

Have you noticed any errors? Please describe them or provide links to issues if you have already reported them.

> I have not noticed any errors.

#### JS golem-js

Is JS SDK API intuitive and helps solve the tasks? If not, what would you change?

> Yes the API is very intuitive and easy to use. I did not have any issues using the API. However the true test would be in more complex scenarios and use cases.

Have you encountered any errors in the golem-js lib? Provide the link(s) to the issue(s) in `golem-js` [repository](https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-js/issues) which you had reported.

> No I have not encountered any errors.

What additional features would you add?

> I think the API is very well designed and has all the necessary features. I can't think of any additional features that would be useful.

#### General feedback

What was your general experience with Golem Network? What was difficult/frustrating?
What was a nice surprise?

> I think the Golem Network is a very interesting project. I think it has a lot of potential and I'm very excited to see how it evolves.
> As for the surprise, I'm very much amazed by the stability and dependability of the network. I was expecting a lot of issues and bugs but I haven't encountered any so far. I think this is a very good sign.

In what projects could you utilize Golem Network?

> There are potentially a lot of use cases for the Golem Network. I think the most obvious use case is for running computationally expensive tasks. I think the Golem Network can be used for a lot of different tasks such as rendering, machine learning, etc.

#### Preview Program

Were the tasks and instructions adequate and clear?

> Yes the tasks and instructions were very clear and easy to follow.

Is there anything you would improve about the JS Preview program?

> The common feedback elements about preview program and general feedback are repeated in every task. There should be a single feedback file for repeating and general elements. The feedback files for each task should only contain feedback specific to that task.
