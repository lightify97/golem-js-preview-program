# Task #4 - Sending files

## Why

The Golem JS SDK lets users send files to providers. 

In this challenge, you will learn how to upload files.

## Task description

Create a tool that uses the Golem Network to host OCR conversion tools on your custom image. You can use the i.e. [tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) engine to create your image.


### Steps

Please observe how long it takes to complete the technical part of the tasks. We will ask you for such information in the feedback form.

1. Create your custom image.

2. Create a requestor script that would take the input image, send it to the provider, run the conversion, and download the output as a file.

3. Add changes in the `send-files` directory.

4. [Fill out the feedback form](./FEEDBACK.md) and publish changes in your repository fork.
