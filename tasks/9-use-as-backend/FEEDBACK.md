### Feedback

#### JS SDK Docs

Could you find the necessary information? If not what topics were difficult to find?

> The JS SDK is very well documented with examples and usage guides. I did not have any difficulty finding my required information on the docs.

---

How would you change the structure/navigation of the docs? Recommend changes.

> I would not change any thing about current structure / navigation of the docs.

---

Are examples and tutorials useful? What was missing, and what was too detailed or unnecessary?

> The examples are useful in general but I would recommend adding more details to some of the sections. Like for this task there was mention of `image` name in the setup step of SDK for the web. It is unclear whether the user can use the has of their images or not as a value in this property.

---

Have you noticed any errors? Please describe them or provide links to issues if you have already reported them.

> I have not encountered any issues / errors.

#### JS golem-js

Is JS SDK API intuitive and helps solve the tasks? If not, what would you change?

> For offloading heavier backend tasks, I found the JS SDK very simple and easy to use. In general using the JS SDK was a nice experience. The greatest feature in SDK, in my opinion, is it's simplicity. In very few lines of code a developer can craft complex computational pipelines from a single file.

---

Have you encountered any errors in the golem-js lib? Provide the link(s) to the issue(s) in `golem-js` [repository](https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-js/issues) which you had reported.

> No, I have not found any error during this task.

---

What additional features would you add?

> No additional features are recommended for this use case.

#### General feedback

What was your general experience with Golem Network? What was difficult/frustrating?
What was a nice surprise?

> Recently there were some hiccups in the network. But the good thing is that all the issues reported were properly announced via the discord group with follow up updates. Stability is very important in distributed computing scenarios and I hope the golem team will recover from all the issues in time for a smooth experience. This is very critical for production use of golem network.

---

In what projects could you utilize Golem Network?

> There are many use cases. I have described this at length in previous tasks.

#### Preview Program

Were the tasks and instructions adequate and clear?

> The task was very clearly describe with links to relevant information/ documentation. It was a nice experience.

---

Is there anything you would improve about the JS Preview program?

> The preview program is nicely crafted to make golem network as a whole a better service.
