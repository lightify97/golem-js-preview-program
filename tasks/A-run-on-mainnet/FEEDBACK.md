## Task #10 - Running on Mainnet
![3](https://github.com/lightify97/golem-js-preview-program/assets/16276964/96623e26-86b5-4769-a76f-df34807231c6)

### Estimated completion time

| Task Step              | Completion Time (in minutes) |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Yagna configuration    | 20                           |
| Acquiring Tokens       | 90                           |
| Script reconfiguration | 15                           |

List any additional steps that were necessary to resolve the task (other than the steps in the README.md):

-   Getting the Matic tokens into yagna wallet was the most time consuming part in this task. This is not a technical challenge but depends on many different factors including where you are located, payment methods that are available to you, regulatory status and lot of other factors. This involved finding exchanges that support the required token and available payment methods.

### Feedback

#### JS SDK Docs

Could you find the necessary information? If not what topics were difficult to find?

> Yes, the docs were very helpful. I was able to find all the information I needed.

How would you change the structure/navigation of the docs? Recommend changes.

> I think the docs are well structured and easy to navigate. And the search functionality is very helpful.

Are examples and tutorials useful? What was missing, and what was too detailed or unnecessary?

> Yes, the examples and tutorials are very useful. I think the tutorials are very detailed and easy to follow. However I think there should be detailed section for newcomers into the crypto space. This should include how to get started with crypto, how to get tokens, how to use exchanges, how to use wallets, how to use yagna wallet etc. This should be a step by step guide with screenshots and videos. This should be a separate section and should be linked from the main page.

Have you noticed any errors? Please describe them or provide links to issues if you have already reported them.

> I have not encountered any errors.

#### JS golem-js

Is JS SDK API intuitive and helps solve the tasks? If not, what would you change?

> Yes, the API is very intuitive and easy to use. I did not have any issues with the API. Furthermore, when running the tasks on mainnet with live payments the filtering and limiting features of the API were very helpful. This is very useful when one is running tasks with real payments and want to actively control the spendings.

Have you encountered any errors in the golem-js lib? Provide the link(s) to the issue(s) in `golem-js` [repository](https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-js/issues) which you had reported.

> I have not encountered any errors during this task.

What additional features would you add?

> I think the API is very well designed and has all the necessary features. I did not feel the need for any additional features.

#### General feedback
