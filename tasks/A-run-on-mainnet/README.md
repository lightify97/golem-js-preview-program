# Task #7 - Sail on the mainnet

## Why

Golem Network `mainnet` providers can much more resources than the `testnet`. 

In this challenge, you will run a task on a `mainnet` network using real Golem tokens.

## Task description

Acquire GLM and MATIC to your requestorâ€™s address, enable payments on the mainnet network, and run any of your scripts on the paid network.

### Steps

Please observe how long it takes to complete the technical part of the tasks. We will ask you for such information in the feedback form.

1. Back up the `yagna` wallet and secure `yagna` by locking the key. Configure it to allow payments on the Polygon Network.

2. Acquire MATIC and swap some of them to GLM.

3. Configure your scripts to run on the Polygon Network.

4. Add changes in the `run-on-mainnet` directory.

5. [Fill out the feedback form](./FEEDBACK.md) and publish changes in your repository fork.
